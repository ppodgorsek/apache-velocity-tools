  <name>Apache Velocity Tools - Examples (migrated to Jarkata)</name>
  <description>
    Examples to show how to use Velocity Tools.
    PLEASE NOTE: this is a temporary fork to unblock projects migrating to Jakarta,
    but I won't continue maintaining it in the future as the Velocity team doesn't
    understand the value of Jakarta. I strongly suggest you plan a switch to a more
    modern template engine such as Thymeleaf.
